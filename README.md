# Solid Waste Incineration Automatic Cat Litter Box

This project is an open-source initiative to develop a fully automated cat litter box with a solid waste incineration feature. The goal of this cat litter box is to automatically handle and dispose of waste, ensuring a clean environment for your cat.

## Features

- **Incineration Unit**: Uses induction heating technology to safely incinerate solid waste.
- **Automatic Cleaning**: A scraper mechanism moves solid waste into the incineration unit, initiating the incineration process automatically.
- **Safety Design**: The incineration unit is fully enclosed to prevent accidental entry by the cat.
- **Smart Features**: Utilizes sensors and automation technology to monitor the cat’s health and the litter box status.
